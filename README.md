Downloading YouTube videos directly is against YouTube's terms of service unless the video explicitly allows downloading through YouTube's own platform. However, if you're looking to save videos for offline viewing through legal means, here are a few options:  
YouTube Premium: Subscribe to YouTube Premium, which allows you to download videos for offline viewing on mobile devices.
YouTube Offline Mode: Some regions and devices allow video downloads for offline viewing via the YouTube app without a Premium subscription. This feature is limited to certain videos.
